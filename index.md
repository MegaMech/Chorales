# Welcome to the Chorale Encyclopedia.

## The cornerstone of the chorale.

The spiritual power and beauty that eminates from the chorale derives from one significant component labeled four-part harmony which essentially dwells among all classical music. It exists as a set of fluctuating guidelines that composers employ to determine the structure of music. Musicologists have attributed the establishment of four-part harmony to Guido d'Arezzo. However, modern voice leading was not practiced until the writings of Johannes Tinctoris (1435-1511). Tinctoris desired music to resolve dissonant sounds. Composers continue to use this concept today choosing which rules to follow and when to resolve the tensions they create. This means that the concept of music may be simplified to the idea of creating tension and resolving that tension.

This chorale book does not exist solely as an investigation into chorale music and its affiliated religious contexts. It also considers the very structure of the music and the observation of those characteristics existing in other musics. Therefore the inclusion of any scores written in a chorale-like format are considered as the very nature of this book is the pursuit in educating of many types and styles of music.
